## ✨ Introduction

This is a simple tool that helps you create logos for your side projects using icons from multiple libraries.

I know there are many logo generator tools that work in similar ways, but I’m not aware of any that allow using multiple icon libraries at the same time. Most of these tools are typically based on a single library.

The live version currently uses icons from five different icon libraries. When running it locally, you can add more libraries or swap them out.

## 🚀 Features

  - [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/)

  - [HugeIcons](https://hugeicons.com/) (free icons only)
- 🎨 Customize colors, sizes, and layouts
